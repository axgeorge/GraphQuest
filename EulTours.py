INTERACTIVE EULERIAN TOUR EXPLORER

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Right-click to place a **vehicle depot** (black).
- Left-click to place a **target node** (red).
- Press **SPACEBAR** to generate Eulerian tours.
- Press **C** to clear the grid and try again.

FEATURES:
- **Multi-vehicle routing** using minimum spanning trees.
- **Eulerian tour generation** with directional edge coloring (forward = black, return = green).
- Flexible and interactive â€” define your own scenarios in real time!
