# GraphQuest

*A visual journey through graph algorithms.*

Build your own graph instances in an interactive grid world.  
Visualize how classic algorithms like **Kruskal’s**, **Dijkstra’s**, **A\***, and **Depth-First Search** solve them in real time.

---

## Getting Started

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/axgeorge/graphquest.git
cd graphquest
```

### Set up environment (with venv)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Algorithms

Each algorithm has its own script. To run one, simply execute:

```bash
python Dijkstra.py
python Astar.py
python Kruskals.py
python EulTours.py
```
